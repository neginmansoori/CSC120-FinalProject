# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

 We integrated the game ideas that some team members had, created a draft of the classes, their attibutes, methods their relation, and how they would come together in the game class. Then, we created a shared document to share progress, ideas and suggestions, and divided up the main classes to code. Once having done that, we edited the whole code as a whole, which included working on codes written by others.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

 It is one thing to create different classes and have a main class to bring them all together, I learned how challenging it is to actually assemble a game out of the classes. It was challenging to keep track of everything, and make sure the classes had records of their aggregated classes and etc. Our group solved this issue by creating a shared Google Docs file to keep track of everthing, additionally, the arcitectural diagrams were helpful in efficiently calrifying the relationship between classes. Our approach will not be efficient in larger-scale projects, which makes me wonder about how larger collaborative projects work. During this process, I discovered how challengin it was for me to work on and debug the codes written by other people. It was a time-consuming process as 90% of my energy went into understanding their approach and 10% of it to modifying it.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

 The way the code analyzes the text. At the moment it has the vocabulary sufficient to recognize some words and carry the code forward. It would be cooler if instead of recognizing the text to "translate" it to a keywork or an option, it would be completely based on the player responses.
 
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

 In order to sophisticate the customer instances, we could create an enum of different food palates, and create a random combination of the enums. By doing so, we could also modify the questions they ask to be more specific to their ordered food.

 I would also add the ability for the waiter to work on multiple tables during one game, and add an additional class of kitchen, to have more personalized interactions with kitchen. Moreover, I would implement unit testing.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

 Keep it simple, by my teammates. This was a very helpful piece of feedback because it minimized unnecessary confusing chunks in the code and increased its efficiency in communication and function.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

 Be patient with yourself in reviewing other people's work, and have the architectural diagram by your side when reviewing their code. 

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

 I had a fun time working on this porject with my team members. Initially, during the brainstorming sessions, we were able to integrate the two ideas proposed by some of the members, and were equally engaged in the brainstorming and the designing, which set a positive tone for the project. We had clear and respectful communication around dividing up the work, our expected deadline for ourselves and our feedback for each other. Additionally, the team members were very responsible, which reinforced the positive environment of collaboration and working.
